# ðŸ“š Self-Learning Python Projects

This repository contains all the Python projects and practice exercises I created as part of my self-learning journey.  
The projects cover a wide range of topics, from basic syntax to intermediate-level problem-solving.

I'll continue to update this repository regularly as I learn more and build new projects.

Stay tuned for more!
