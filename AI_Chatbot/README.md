# ðŸ¤– WhatsApp AI Chatbot (Self-Learning Project)

This repository contains a simple AI-powered WhatsApp chatbot that I built as part of my self-learning journey in Python and AI integration.

The project focuses on integrating a basic chatbot with WhatsApp using available APIs and libraries. 

It is designed for experimentation and personal understanding of how messaging bots work in real-time environments.

I'll continue refining this project as I learn more about AI, NLP, and chatbot development.
